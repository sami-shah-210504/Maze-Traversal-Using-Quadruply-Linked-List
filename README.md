# Maze-Traversal-Using-Quadruply-Linked-List
This was quiet a long DSA assignment but the problem that most interested me was the last maze question. It baffled me at first but I liked it because it was a mini-project of sorts. Now normally people would implement a maze using a quadruply linked list by using four node pointers; up, down, left, right. That implementation is pretty fun and makes intuituve sense. But I did it using  only the right and down pointers to achieve much the same effect.
